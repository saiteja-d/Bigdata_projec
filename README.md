# This repo is Project work done for ISM Big Data Course.

We’ve chose the dataset of a Brazilian Ecommerce website “OLIST” from kaggle. The details which OLIST has provided us are 9 different datasets each detailing the customers, their geolocation, orders placed, orders sold, items available, payment methods used by customers, order reviews & order delivery information. 

The analysis on the dataset is done by Apache Spark through various models like recommendation systems based on carrying out predictive analytics on users’ preferences, predicting the future sales on the basis of purchase date & discovering unsatisfied customers prone to certain product categories, clustered the customers based on Recency, Frequency and Monetary value.

The above analysis has been in carried out in Apache pyspark 2.4.1 on both Cloudera platform and on Data bricks cloud environment.
